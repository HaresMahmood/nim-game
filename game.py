"""
`game.py`:
Command-line interface, represents a game of mis√®re Nim.
AI can be modified to user minimax or MCTS.
Game states are represented in the following way:
   * [x, y, z]
      - Where `x`, `y` and `z` are the number of sticks in their
      respective pile, being the index at which they are present
      in the list.

Rules:
   * `x` number of piles with a random number of sticks is
   generated at the start of the game, where `x` is determined
   by the user.
   * The user chooses whether they want to start or not 
   (Player 1 or Player 2).
   * Once the game starts, each player can take up to 3 sticks at
   once from a single pile.
   * The player that has to take the last stick loses.
